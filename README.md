Slides, discussions, notes and project handouts for Berkeley's Database course CS186. 

I deleted the duplicate and blank slide pages and converted slides to pdf for convenience. There may be some labels I made on notes and slides as well.

Project 1 implementations is **here**.

Version: *2022 Spring*.
